                    Kalpana Chawla was an Indian-born American astronaut and 
                    engineer who was the first Indian woman to fly in space. 
                    She flew on two space shuttle missions, STS-87 in 1997 and 
                    STS-107 in 2003, as a mission specialist and primary robotic 
                    arm operator. She died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster 
                    in 2003 when it broke up on re-entry into Earth's atmosphere,
                    along with six other crew members. 

                    Chawla's legacy has lived on. However, in particular, 
                    her talent and hard work have inspired young people in India 
                    and around Earth to consider careers in spaceflight. 
                    She is a role model for many young girls interested in 
                    science and technology.

                    Kalpana Chawla was born on 17 March 1962 in a Punjabi 
                    Hindu family in Karnal, Haryana.The youngest of four children,
                    she was born into a conservative society, but Chawla broke 
                    several traditions to become the first Indian-born female astronaut. 
                    She completed her schooling from Tagore Baal Niketan Senior 
                    Secondary School, Karnal in 1976. Growing up, Chawla went to 
                    local flying clubs and watched planes with her father.

                    Did Bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering from 
                    Punjab Engineering College, India, 1982.

                    In 1988, Kalpana Chawla started work at NASA Ames Research 
                    Center in the area of powered-lift computational fluid dynamics. 
                    Her research concentrated on simulation of complex air flows 
                    encountered around aircraft such as the Harrier in "ground-effect." 
                    Following completion of this project she supported research in 
                    mapping of flow solvers to parallel computers, and testing of these 
                    solvers by carrying out powered lift computations. In 1993 Kalpana 
                    Chawla joined Overset Methods Inc., Los Altos, California, as Vice
                    President and Research Scientist to form a team with other researchers 
                    specializing in simulation of moving multiple body problems. She was 
                    responsible for development and implementation of efficient techniques 
                    to perform aerodynamic optimization. Results of various projects that 
                    Kalpana Chawla participated in are documented in technical conference 
                    papers and journals.

                    Selected by NASA in December 1994, Kalpana Chawla reported 
                    to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995 as an astronaut 
                    candidate in the 15th Group of Astronauts. After completing 
                    a year of training and evaluation, she was assigned as crew 
                    representative to work technical issues for the Astronaut 
                    Office EVA/Robotics and Computer Branches. Her assignments 
                    included work on development of Robotic Situational Awareness 
                    Displays and testing space shuttle control software in the Shuttle 
                    Avionics Integration Laboratory. In November, 1996, Kalpana Chawla 
                    was assigned as mission specialist and prime robotic arm operator 
                    on STS-87. In January 1998, she was assigned as crew representative 
                    for shuttle and station flight crew equipment, and subsequently 
                    served as lead for Astronaut Office's Crew Systems and Habitability 
                    section. She flew on STS-87 (1997) and STS-107 (2003), logging 30 
                    days, 14 hours and 54 minutes in space.

                    STS-87 Columbia (November 19 to December 5, 1997). STS-87 was 
                    the fourth U.S Microgravity Payload flight and focused on experiments 
                    designed to study how the weightless environment of space affects 
                    various physical processes, and on observations of the Sun's outer 
                    atmospheric layers. Two members of the crew performed an EVA 
                    (spacewalk) which featured the manual capture of a Spartan satellite, 
                    in addition to testing EVA tools and procedures for future Space 
                    Station assembly. STS-87 made 252 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.5 
                    million miles in 376 hours and 34 minutes.
                    
                    STS-107 Columbia (January 16 to February 1, 2003). The 16-day flight 
                    was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, 
                    in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 
                    80 experiments. The STS-107 mission ended abruptly on February 1, 2003 
                    when Space Shuttle Columbia and the crew perished during entry, 16 
                    minutes prior to scheduled landing.
